## The static analysis of a random git repository using the ‘mypy’ tool :

● The reference git repository link: https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter

● The command to install mypy on the command line:  python -m pip install mypy

## Step - 1
● First cloning random repository from git hub

## Analysis of tool(mypy):
-> Improved Code Quality: By identifying type mistakes and enabling developers to rectify them before the code is executed, Mypy aids in enhancing code quality. As a result, the code becomes more reliable and has fewer flaws.

-> Increased Productivity: Developers may save time and be more productive by catching problems using Mypy early in the development cycle. Also, it makes code maintenance simpler over time.

-> Better Collaboration: Mypy's type annotations make code more readable and understandable, which can improve collaboration between team members. It also helps new team members understand the codebase faster.

-> Integrations with Popular Editors: Mypy interfaces with well-known editors like PyCharm and Visual Studio Code, making it simpler to use and boosting developer output.


## Understanding of Errors:

-> Python has a static type checker called Mypy that helps find common mistakes and enhance code quality. Mypy analyses your Python code and looks for type issues when you run it.

-> When a value of one type is utilised in a situation where it is incompatible with another type, type errors happen. For instance, mypy will notice a type error if you attempt to concatenate a string and an integer.

-> A type error will be reported by Mypy as an error message along with details about where the mistake occurred in the code. The error notice will outline the issue and offer advice on how to resolve it.
